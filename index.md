## Capstone Project Summary
This projects demonstrates how to setup a secure network that can allow authorized individuals to access resources on an organization's local network from any remote location using a modern browser.

More specifically, the project will accomplish the following goals:
1. Configure a physical server with a Type 1 Hypervisor to host virtual machines.
2. Create a virtual machine that will run Docker and Kasm (a container streaming platform).
3. Create a custom container image that can be streamed using Kasm.
4. Set up a virtual private network using Tailscale.
5. Securing the network to only allow authorized access using multiple techniques (setting up a DMZ, creating firewall rules using UFW/iptables, creating ACLs, etc.)
